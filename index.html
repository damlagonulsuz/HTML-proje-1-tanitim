<h3>Series That I Like</h3>
<h4>The Office</h4>
<p>The Office is an American mockumentary sitcom television series that depicts the everyday work lives of office
    employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. It aired on NBC from
    March 24, 2005, to May 16, 2013, spanning a total of nine seasons.[1] Based on the 2001–2003 BBC series of the same
    name created by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, it was adapted for American television by Greg Daniels, a veteran
    writer for Saturday Night Live, King of the Hill, and The Simpsons. It was co-produced by Daniels's Deedle-Dee
    Productions, and Reveille Productions (later Shine America), in association with Universal Television. The original
    executive producers were Daniels, Gervais, Merchant, Howard Klein, and Ben Silverman, with numerous others being
    promoted in later seasons.
